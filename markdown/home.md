## Namespacing in OOP

Before the era of Apple Music or YouTube, we stored all our music files on our computers, MP3 players, or iPods. We would keep them on the device we connected our headphones to and listen from there.

To keep our music organized, we categorized it by artist, favorite songs, or genre rather than scrolling through one long list of songs. Namespaces in OOP work similarly.

Namespaces help us structure our files in a logical way, making them easier to find and manage. Just as you might store AC/DC in a "Rock" folder, in OOP, a UserController might be placed in an Auth namespace.
